The annual \neconomic cost of road crashes in Australia \nis estimated to be $30 billion, which is \naccompanied by devastating social impacts.\nWhile many factors contribute to safety on the \nroad, driver health and fitness to drive is an \nimportant consideration. Drivers must meet \ncertain medical standards to ensure their health \nstatus does not unduly increase their crash risk.\nAssessing fitness to drive is a joint publication \nof Austroads and the National Transport \nCommission (NTC) and details medical standards \nfor driver licensing purposes for use by health \nprofessionals and driver licensing authorities. \nThe standards are approved by Commonwealth, \nstate and territory transport ministers and were \nfirst published in their current form in 2003.

This may be: \n• for initial licensing of some vehicle classes \n(e.g. multiple combination heavy vehicles)\n• as a requirement for a conditional licence\n• for assessing a person whose driving the \ndriver licensing authority believes may be \nunsafe (i.e. ‘for cause’ examinations) \n• for licence renewal of an older driver (in",

Most patients diagnosed \nwith PNES self-report loss of responsiveness \nor loss of awareness that may place them \nat an increased risk of causing a motor \nvehicle accident.\nThe safety risk is sufficiently low after a three-\nmonth period, with no further psychogenic \nseizures, to allow a return to driving. People with \nactive PNES should generally not be allowed to \ndrive if they lose awareness or responsiveness \nwith their psychogenic seizures, have a history \nof seizure related injuries, or if the semiology \nsuggests that ability to drive would be impaired \nduring a psychogenic seizure.",

In addition, \nsome people may have other central disorders \nof hypersomnolence such as idiopathic \nhypersomnia. For drivers with idiopathic \nhypersomnia or sleepiness due to other central",

A total of 16 studies (two non-RCT and 14 non-RCT) were reviewed; two RCTs investigated the effect of driving rehabilitation with a simulator system, and eight and six non-RCTS evaluated the predictive factors of driving return post-stroke and compared the effects of driving rehabilitation for stroke, respectively. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and having paid employment were significant predictors of resuming driving after stroke. The results suggest that NIHSS, MMSE, and paid employment are predictors of returning to driving post-stroke.

Risk of Bias in All Included Studies for Predictors to Return to Driving after Stroke \nThe risk of bias arising from the selection of participants revealed concerns about one \nstudy and its retrospective study design. The confounding variables had an unclear risk \nof bias in seven studies [1,4,10,11,19–21]. Only confounding variables were identiﬁed, and \nstatistical correction was performed during the statistical analysis stage [2]. The risk of \nbias for the measurement of intervention/exposure was low in seven studies in which data \nwere obtained from trustworthy sources (e.g., medical records and clinical measurement \ntools) [1,2,4,10,11,20,21]; however, one study had no medical information, clinical \nmeasurement tools, or questionnaire from structural interviews [19]. Blinding for outcome \nmeasurement showed a low risk of bias in se ven studies [1,2,4,11,19–21], and its absence \nwas judged to have no eﬀect on outcome measurement, although blinding was not present",

Driving is \nimportant for individuals as it enables participation and access to services within the community. While \naccess to the community is considered a right, driving is a privilege due to the complex interaction of \nskills required to operate a vehicle safely in the community.

The results of the national survey of health professionals revealed that health \nprofessionals lack knowledge about RTD guidelines , and the management of RTD is being \ndeferred to other health professionals.

The effects of stroke can include weakness in arms and legs, and difficulty with \nspeaking, thinking and vision. Stroke occurs in approximately 60,000 people in Australia each \nyear, and stroke is Aus tralia’s second largest killer and cause of disability  (National Stroke \nFoundation, 2010b). A major predictor of a patient’s return to independence post -stroke, and \nhence quality of life, is the ability to drive (Poole, Chaudry, & Jay, 2008). In Australia, all survivors \nare restricted in driving for four weeks after stroke and for two weeks after transient ischaemic \nattack (TIA) (Austroads and National Transport Commission, 2016).  \n \n1.2 Rationale \nLittle is known about health professionals’ and stroke survivors ’ knowledge of the  nationally-\nagreed guidelines concerning the management of return to driving (RTD) after stroke and TIA.",

Stroke is one of Australia’s largest causes of death and disability. Each \nyear, 60,000 Australians experience strokes, and one in six people will experience strokes in their \nlifetimes. Over 50% of new or recurrent strokes affect those aged over 75 years of age. Stroke is \nestimated to cost the Australian community $5 billion a year (Australian Institute of Health and \nWelfare, 2013). \n \nOne-third of people with stroke experience impairments that impact their ability to carry out \neveryday activities (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2013 ).

I n \nAustralia, following stroke, survivors are restricted in driving for four weeks, and after TIA, they \nare restricted for two weeks.

Even so, there are significant functional impairments \nresulting from stroke that can also impact driving. After stroke and TIA, medical clearance is",

In Australia, there is a four-week restriction \nin driving after stroke and a two -week restriction after TIA. The aim of the systematic review \nwas to determine whether health prof essionals working in acute hospitals routinely provide \neducation on restrictions in driving after stroke or TIA, prior to the patient leaving hospital. The \nsecond aim was to determine whether stroke survivors actually adhere to driving restrictions \nand when people with mild stroke or TIA return to driving.  \n3.2 Manuscript \nThis manuscript was published as: Frith, J., Hubbard , I.J., James , C.L. &  Warren-Forward, H . \n(2015) Returning to driving after stroke: A systematic review investigating adherence to",

Johnston et al., 2004; \nMcCarron et al., 2008) investigating the management of return to driving (RTD) after stroke and \ntransient ischaemic attack (TIA) in the acute hospital setting. A lthough driving after stroke is a \nwell-researched topic, the systematic review revealed that the management of RTD for the \npatient with stroke or TIA discharged directly home from  the acute setting ( the study’s \nparticipant cohort) is not (Frith et al., 2015). As the published literature was based on studies in \nthe United Kingdom, more extensive research is required.  \nThe aim of this study was to investigate current practice in Australia in the management of RTD \nfor patients with stroke and TIA who are discharged directly home from the acute hospital. The \nstudy was undertaken in one tertiary hospital in New South Wales, Australia. It included an audit",

The precursors to having RTD education \ndocumented in the medical records were input by occupational therapist s, documentation of \ncognitive impairment, and patients who were male (Frith et al., 2017). With only 50% of patients \nbeing seen by occupational therapists (Biswas et al., 2006; Frith et al., 2017), the findings from \nthis study provide one reason why some patients in the study’s cohort may not be receiving the \nrecommended RTD management in the acute hospital setting.

Gaps potentially relate to the role of the multiprofessional team in providing education \nto patients with stroke a nd TIA about restrictions in driving and in the documentation of RTD \nmanagement plans.",

    "text": "5.2 Return to driving after stroke: Knowledge of health professionals \n5.2.1 Introduction \nThe ability to drive a motor vehicle has a significant impact on the quality of life of stroke \nsurvivors and is a major predictor of a stroke survivor’s return to independence (Griffen, \nRapport, Bryer, & Scott, 2009 ; Liddle et al., 2009 ; Lister, 1999; Patomella, Johansson, & Tham, \n2009). The deficits that result from stroke and can impact the ability to drive a motor vehicle are \nwell-researched (Fisk et al., 2002 ; Lee et al., 2003 ; McKay et al., 2011 ). They include (i) upper \nand lower limb sensorimotor dysfunction ; (ii) impairments in judgement, mental processing, \ncomprehension and reaction time; and (iii) deficits in peripheral vision (Devos et al., 2011). \n \nEven if a person has a mild stroke, impairments such as visual field deficits, sensorimotor \ndysfunction and poor concentration can still be present during the initial recovery phase of",

Rothwell and Warlow (2005) reported that 17% of TIAs occur on the same day \nof a stroke, 9% on the day before a stroke and 43% in the week preceding a stroke. Furthermore, \nfollowing stroke, there is also a 9% incidence of seizures within the first two years (Bladin et al., \n2000; Yale, Hansotia, Knapp, & John, 2003).

For \nexample, in the acute hospital setting, only 50% of patients with stroke may see occupational \ntherapists (Biswas et al., 2006 ; Frith et al., 2017 ).

The findings also revealed that a contributing factor to this practice-evidence gap is the \nlack of knowledge of clinical guidelines by health professionals and the reported uncertainty \nregarding their roles and responsibilities. As a result, health professionals tend to defer the \nmanagement of RTD to others , and persons with stroke and TIA are often left confused about \nhow to manage their own RTD.

The Stroke Foundation’s Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management recommend that \nthose with stroke and TIA receive both verbal and written information regarding the \nmanagement of return to driving (RTD) (National Stroke Foundation, 2010a). People who have \nmild stroke and whose impairments do not warrant further inpatient rehabilita tion need to \nreceive RTD management plans prior to discharge home from the acute hospital setting. There \nis little evidence regarding how well RTD is managed in the acute hospital setting. In the absence \nof this evidence, concerns exist as to whether strok e and TIA survivors are receiving education \nabout restrictions in driving and , in turn, are able to make informed decisions about RTD.

A decision tree is suggested to build \npatient-centred procedures for returning to driving along the post-stroke recovery trajectory.   \n \nPart one reviews literature on the return to driving process post-stroke and identifies gaps in \nknowledge.  The stroke recovery trajectory’s three main phases of recovery (acute, \nrehabilitation and community care) are outlined and act as a framework for the thesis \nstructure.  Part two of the thesis describes five separate but related studies carried out to \naddress the research gaps identified. \n \nThe first study is a qualitative study that examines attitudes and perceptions of stroke \nsurvivors from one to 16 weeks post-stroke.  Independence was found to be the primary \nmotivator in stroke survivors’ decisions about fitness to drive.  However, during the acute",

In turn, this will place pressure on existing driving assessment \nservices and licensing authorities in order to adequately address road safety issues.

Accordingly, the \nnumber of people experiencing stroke is predicted to continue to increase in Australia and \ninternationally due to the ageing of the population, and will see a consequential increase in \nthose living longer with chronic diseases including stroke (AIHW, 2014).  It is therefore \nlikely there will be a commensurate increase in the number of stroke survivors who face the \ndecision about whether to return to driving.   The scope of this literature review aims to \nexamine the current evidence relating to the process of returning to driving post-stroke and \nthe decision to relinquish a driver’s licence both within Australia and internationally.

No significant practice effect was found between three month UFOV \nassessments scores for the control and assessment groups.  The assessment group showed a \nsignificant difference in the selective attention subtest three scores between months one and \nthree, which may suggest an improvement in selective attention skill, but this did not \nstatistically significantly affect the overall results. \n \nThe finding of no practice effect found in this thesis study contributes to evidence that the \nUFOV assessment has a psychometric advantage as a tool to be utilised in clinical practice to \nprompt referral for an on-road assessment, but is by no means conclusive.  Although this \nstudy results contribute to evidence that the UFOV assessment does not have a practice effect",

Stepwise logistic regression showed that the presence of \ninstrumental sequelae, mainly aphasia, was the best predictor of fitness-to-drive recommendations. \nConclusions: The post-stroke time interval and the presence of instrumental sequelae explained the difference \nbetween patients recommended as fit-to-drive and unfit-to-drive. Furthermore, aphasia was found be the best \npredictor of a fitness-to-drive recommendation. It is possible that aphasia impacts the understanding of in -\nstructions during on-road testing. These findings emphasize the need for a standardized multi-professional \nfitness-to-drive assessment, since the determinants of fitness-to-drive recommendation differ between studies.   \nIntroduction \nEvery year in France, strokes affect 140 000 people, and are the first",
